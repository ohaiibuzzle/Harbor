  <h4 align="center">A simple, stupid wrapper for Apple's Game Porting Toolkit</p>
</p>

# What's this?
Basically, it's a Wine wrapper with QoL features that eases the installation process of Apple's GPTK (via their homebrew tap)

# What's up with the icon?
Cooked up in about 2 minutes with IconKitchen. I'm a software engineer, not a graphic designer.

# Too simplistic?
If you are in need of something *stronger*, get [Whisky](https://github.com/IsaacMarovitz/Whisky). This is just the bare minimum to get GPTK working

Have fun and report bugs!
